### 1) ./modules/collisions.cpp

- dont really like the implementation of near distances, set_abs etc. splitting between two object types. 

###  2) How to deal with Mob Entity right way - I want to avoid enum/bool in entity search - shall I have additional table with SpawnedMobs. It will have entity Id?
Maybe just keep all of it in entities. It cant be that bad? Dont overengineer it 


### 3) 3d models instead of spritesheets:
 - photogrammetry
 - meshroom 
 - https://www.mixamo.com/
 - blender
 - blender python api
 - PIFuh by facebook
 - gITF file format

 ### 4) menu highliting -> nice feature to have :)

 ### 5) saves scrolling

 ### 6) Debug -> want to display points (little quads), lines, and right click menu with information, outline of the object
