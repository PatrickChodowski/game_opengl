### 1) ./modules/collisions.cpp

- dont really like the implementation of near distances, set_abs etc. splitting between two object types. 

###  4) How to deal with Mob Entity right way - I want to avoid enum/bool in entity search - shall I have additional table with SpawnedMobs. It will have entity Id?
Maybe just keep all of it in entities. It cant be that bad? Dont overengineer it 


### 5) 3d models instead of spritesheets:
 - photogrammetry
 - meshroom 
 - https://www.mixamo.com/
 - blender
 - blender python api
 - PIFuh by facebook
 - gITF file format
